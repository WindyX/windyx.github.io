Although some scholars have used network pharmacology to study the target prediction of TCM prescriptions, all of them are for the analysis of a specific prescription-disease association, and the universal method for predicting effect targets of TCM prescriptions has not discovered yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph Relational Path Network for Target Prediction of TCM Prescriptions (KGRN), which can integrate prescription’s molecular and target information through the Knowledge Graph (KG). At the same time, the semantic information and high-level structure of the knowledge graph are extracted through Knowledge Graph Embedding and Graph Neural Networks, which can effectively capture the correlation between the prescriptions and the targets. Moreover, by emphasizing the KG relations when aggregating neighborhood information, the Relational Path Network of the KGRN model has the ability to capture the relationship dependence in the KG path, which enhances the ability to predict the relationship between the prescriptions and the targets. The experiments under multiple configurations demonstrate that KGRN outperforms the related competitive benchmarks.	Z. Gong, N. Zhang, and J. He. (2021).

Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has been widely used in knowledge graph embedding because of its powerful feature extraction ability, and most KGE models based on GNN use aggregation operations to extract potential information from the triples. Unfortunately, they only emphasize entity embedding and use shallow operations to update relations. As a result, the learning of relation embedding is relatively simple. And they ignore the rich inference information contained in the multi-hop paths. In addition, their complex network structure lacks regularization constraint, which is prone to the over-fitting problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention with relation paths model for knowledge graph embedding adversarial learning (HARPA). HARPA constructs a two-layer attention encoder to learn the information of triples and neighborhoods at the triples-level and further utilizes the rich inference information of paths to deeply learn relation embedding at the paths-level. Besides, HARPA proposes an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) named I-GAN as the regularization term of the model, which imposes constraints on the process of learning embedding and enables the model to learn high-quality and robust embedding. The link prediction experiments on four general knowledge graphs show that the HARPA model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.	N. Zhang, J. Wang, and J.
