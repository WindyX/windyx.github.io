excerpt: 'Accurately predicting the effect targets of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions is essential for exploring the molecular mechanism and clarifying the mechanism of TCM. Although some scholars have used network pharmacology to study the target prediction of TCM prescriptions, all of them are for the analysis of a specific prescription-disease association, and the universal method for predicting effect targets of TCM prescriptions has not discovered yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph Relational Path Network for Target Prediction of TCM Prescriptions (KGRN), which can integrate prescription’s molecular and target information through the Knowledge Graph (KG). At the same time, the semantic information and high-level structure of the knowledge graph are extracted through Knowledge Graph Embedding and Graph Neural Networks, which can effectively capture the correlation between the prescriptions and the targets. Moreover, by emphasizing the KG relations when aggregating neighborhood information, the Relational Path Network of the KGRN model has the ability to capture the relationship dependence in the KG path, which enhances the ability to predict the relationship between the prescriptions and the targets. The experiments under multiple configurations demonstrate that KGRN outperforms the related competitive benchmarks.'

Accurately predicting the effect targets of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) prescriptions is essential for exploring the molecular mechanism and clarifying the mechanism of TCM. Although some scholars have used network pharmacology to study the target prediction of TCM prescriptions, all of them are for the analysis of a specific prescription-disease association, and the universal method for predicting effect targets of TCM prescriptions has not discovered yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a Knowledge Graph Relational Path Network for Target Prediction of TCM Prescriptions (KGRN), which can integrate prescription’s molecular and target information through the Knowledge Graph (KG). At the same time, the semantic information and high-level structure of the knowledge graph are extracted through Knowledge Graph Embedding and Graph Neural Networks, which can effectively capture the correlation between the prescriptions and the targets. Moreover, by emphasizing the KG relations when aggregating neighborhood information, the Relational Path Network of the KGRN model has the ability to capture the relationship dependence in the KG path, which enhances the ability to predict the relationship between the prescriptions and the targets. The experiments under multiple configurations demonstrate that KGRN outperforms the related competitive benchmarks.
